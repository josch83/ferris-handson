# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated byan adaptation and extension of the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

The following files will only be generated, if they do not exist, but not overwritten:
```
.swagger-codegen-ignore
requirements.txt
```

## Requirements
Python 3.11+

## Usage
To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:
The buildin-requirements.txt are already build into the docker base image

```
pip3 install -r buildin-requirements.txt
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m josch83_api
```

and open your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:8080/ui/
```

Your Swagger definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8080/swagger.json
```

To launch the integration tests, use tox:
```
sudo pip install tox
tox
```

## Running with Docker

To run the server on a Docker container, please execute the following from the root directory:

```bash

# building the image
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t josch83_api .

# starting up a container
docker run -p 8080:8080 josch83_api
```
